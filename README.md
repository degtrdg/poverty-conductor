# poverty-conductor

Personal worktree management inspired by conductor.build (made this when it broke over the weekend).

## Scripts

- `scripts/worktree.sh` - Create new worktree with random city name
  - I use this to create new worktrees.
- `scripts/worktree-manager.sh` - Manage existing worktrees (open/archive)
    - I use this to delete worktrees that I don't need anymore.
- `scripts/conductor-setup.sh` - Setup script for worktree initialization

WARNING: you need to change the paths + customize the setup script to your needs.

I put this in the script/ folder in my monorepo
